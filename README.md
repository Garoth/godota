Go Dota2 API Wrapper
=====================

A concurrent library for fetching statistics from Valve's Dota2 WebAPI.
Currently a work in progress.

TODO
----

- Get hero names from hero IDs, and vice versa
- Get player names from ID, and vice versa
- Figure out how to make options passing to API calls easy / complete
- Create a system to batch together lots Match Details and make them concurrent
  rather than doing one at a time
- Command line arguments for default binary
- Create common code for loading read url into struct

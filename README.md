=====================

A concurrent library for fetching statistics from Valve's Dota2 WebAPI.
Currently a work in progress.

TODO
----

[x] Get Teams List
[x] Get Match History
[x] Get Match Details
[ ] Get hero names from hero IDs, and vice versa
[ ] Get player names from ID, and vice versa
[ ] Figure out how to make options passing to API calls easy / complete
[ ] Create a system to batch together lots Match Details and make them concurrent rather than doing one at a time
[ ] Command line arguments for default binary
